# Description

This is a newer version of a past project connecting to the amazon API for easy creation of product based articles. 
The logged in user can create and edit articles, while users can vote on article segments.  These segments can only be
voted on once by each user.  The project ensures this by capturing the IP address of users and comparing to past voters
of that segment.
